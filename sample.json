{"text": "Art is about the hardest thing to categorize in terms of good and bad. To consider one work or artist as dominate over another comes down to personal opinion. Sure some things maybe blatantly better than other works, but it ultimately lies with the individual. I personally enjoy the work of \"street artists\" (using quotations not to be sarcastic, but mainly because this is in a different category than graffiti and since my background is not in art I don't know what the \"proper\" term is , if there is one), but I do see where you are coming from."}
